## Expo Camera Roll Select
Example of how to build your own multi image picker in react native
without using any native components which means it also works in expo.

I'd love to hear the communities feedback. I can definitely work on
improving it and turn it into an npm package if there is demand.
But for now, I'm just happy to not have to detach from expo!
